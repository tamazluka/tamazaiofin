## Attention

 1. **Do not abuse Heroku's service or your account could get banned. Deploy at your own risk.**
 2. Aria2 & qBittorrent download speed is limited to 5MB/s on default.
 3. Anyone who can login into this app has full access to data in this app and Rclone remotes. Do not share with other ppl, and do not store sensitive information with this app.
 4. To prevent Heroku dyno from auto-sleeping, use website monitoring service such as uptimerobot to http ping your heroku domain every 10 mins.

 2. Rclone runs on daemon mode, easy to manually transfer files and monitor transfers in real time on WebUI.
 3. You can connect Aria2, qBittorrent and Rclone from frontends running on other hosts.
 4. Auto-backup configuration files to Cloudflare Workers KV, and try to restore when dyno restarts.
 5. Execute predefined yt-dlp & Rclone commands from OliveTin WebUI.
 6. ttyd web terminal, which can execute yt-dlp and other commands on the command line.
 7. There are independent logs for each service in the log directory.

## <a id="more"></a>More usages and precautions

 1. Hit shift+F5 to force refresh if web services don't work properly. If app still doesn't work, clear cache and cookie of your heroku domain from browser.
 2. After adding the following content to the end of Rclone config file, you can add local heroku storage in Rclone Web UI for manual upload.

```
[local]
type = alias
remote = /mnt/data
```

 3. It is not possible to configure a Rclone remote which requires web authentication through Rclone web UI in this app.
 4. Aria2 BT tracker list is auto-updated each time dyno restarted, rename or delete /content/aria2/tracker.sh file to disable this function.
 5. Portal page config file homer_en.yml and icon resources are under content/homer_conf directory in repository, use path as ./assets/tools/example.png to add the new icon to homer config file.
 6. Vmess proxy protocol: AlterID is 0, you can connect to either Vmess WS port 80 or Vmess WS tls port 443. Xray settings can be modified via content/xray.yaml file in repository. Heroku is difficult to connect in mainland China.
